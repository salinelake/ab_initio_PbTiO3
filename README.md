# Suppporting materials

Datasets, models and scripts that support the findings of the paper "Thermal disorder and phonon softening in the ferroelectric phase transition of lead titanate" 

Folder "DFT" contains preliminary DFT calculations, including structural relaxation, converence check, etc.

Folder "DPModel" contains datasets, models, and scripts for training the Deep Potential model of PbTiO3. 

Folder "DWModel" contains datasets, models, and scripts for training the Deep Dipole (aka Deep Wannier) model of PbTiO3. 

Folder "MolecularDynamics" contains scripts for MD simulations and data analysis. 

Some simulations requires the DeepMD Plumed Module at github.com/y1xiaoc/deepmd-plumed.
