This folder contains python scripts for data analysis and visulization. The scripts are not fully cleaned up or rerun. So there are some consistency over data pathes. 

The data are from molecular dynamics simulations with the DP (../DPModel/train/final_model/model-compress.pb) and DW models (../DWModel/train/final_model/dipole-compress.pb). Due to size limit of Github, the trajectories are not uploaded. But the simulation can be set up again with the template given within each folder.
